# Weather API Dashboard

## Description

First time using an API! It was tough, learning to navigate the data in the console through fetch in JS is not easy! Then having to pass the information was tough.
Never had the chance to solve the local storage part of it!

Thank you openweathermap.org for letting me use your API!

The dashboard will load with my favorite cities current weather and 5 day forecast.
You can search any city in the search bar for the same results!
